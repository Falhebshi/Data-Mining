# Unraveling Productivity in Garment Factories: A Data Mining Approach

# Project Information

In this project we will analyze the Garment Worker Productivity dataset, collected in the first quarter of 2015 from a garment factory in Bangladesh, to better understand and capture employee performance in the textile industry. The dataset contains 1197 instances recorded across 59 working days, offering insight into how productivity unfolded on the factory floor.

The main objective of our project is to use the garment factory dataset to explore productivity patterns through the means of classification and clustering. In the classification part, productivity will be divided into low, medium, and high levels using decision trees, and we will compare results under different data splits to see how well we can capture team performance. In the clustering part, K-means will be applied with different numbers of groups to see how teams naturally fall into similar categories based on their working conditions and outcomes. By doing this, we aim to spot why some teams consistently achieve their targets and other times not so much, giving a clearer picture of the factors that shape productivity inside the factory.

All in all, the problem we would like to address is the fact that productivity targets in garment factories are often set without a clear understanding of the factors that actually drive performance. This could lead to underperformance, uneven results across teams, and inefficient use of resources. Our project tackles this by applying machine learning tasks to identify the conditions that most influence output and to reveal patterns of team behavior inside the factory. Furthermore, our findings will provide a data backed perspective that can potentially guide fairer incentives, smarter workload distribution, and more realistic target setting. This will ultimately solve the evident disconnect between management expectations and the realities of factory productivity.


# Project Motivation
We chose this dataset because it highlights employee performance and workplace challenges, we think it is important because it helps improve quality, reduce errors, and increase efficiency, and our motivation is to support better decisions that enhance productivity.
