# Unraveling Productivity in Garment Factories: A Data Mining Approach


# Project Information

In this project we will analyze the Garment Worker Productivity dataset, collected in the first quarter of 2015 from a garment factory in Bangladesh, to better understand and capture employee performance in the textile industry. The dataset contains 1197 instances recorded across 59 working days, offering insight into how productivity unfolded on the factory floor.

The main objective of our project is to use this dataset to explore productivity patterns through the means of classification and clustering. For classification, our class label will be actual_productivity, and we will investigate whether it is influenced by the 15 recorded attributes: date, quarter, department, day, team, targeted_productivity, smv, wip, over_time, incentive, idle_time, idle_men, no_of_style_change, and no_of_workers. Secondly, we will perform clustering unlike prior public work done on this dataset. Through it, we will explore how garment factory teams naturally group together based on their working conditions and recorded performance, aiming to reveal hidden patterns of similarity that are not captured by the predefined productivity label.

All in all, the problem we would like to address is the fact that productivity targets in garment factories are often set without a clear understanding of the factors that actually drive performance. This could lead to underperformance, uneven results across teams, and inefficient use of resources. Our project tackles this by applying machine learning tasks to identify the conditions that most influence output and to reveal patterns of team behavior inside the factory. Furthermore, our findings will provide a data backed perspective that can potentially guide fairer incentives, smarter workload distribution, and more realistic target setting. This will ultimately solve the evident disconnect between management expectations and the realities of factory productivity.


# Project Motivation

We chose the Garment Worker Productivity dataset because it highlights a challenge that goes far beyond one factory in Bangladesh: productivity targets are often set without a clear understanding of the conditions that affect performance. This disconnect can lead to ineffecient processes, unpredictable results, and unfair pressure on workers. We think the dataset is important because it captures how real working conditions shape outcomes and offers us a chance to see where performance gains or bottlenecks truly come from. As students, our motivation is driven by curiosity and the desire to gain experience in using data to better understand human behaviour and organizational dynamics.
